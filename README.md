# Geoparty Buzzer

### Overview

Jeoparty is a classic game of trivia that my friends and I have been playing virtually during the COVID-19 social distancing. In Jeoparty, contestents may buzz in to answer the question only after a switch is released after Alex Trebek (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦) is finished reading the question.

GeoParty Buzzer is a simple solution to buzzing in to answer online trivia. When a question is read to completion, the admin can press the **unlock** button, which frees the contestents to buzz in. The first person to press the button has their name displayed and has the floor to answer the question.
